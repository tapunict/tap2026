## Getting started
To download the course material, you can either **clone the repository** or **download the ZIP** file from the course page.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tapunict/tap2026.git
```

## Notebook
All the Jupyter notebooks used in the lectures are stored in the `/doc` folder as `.ipynb` files.
To view them interactively, youâ€™ll need to install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and run:

```bash
quarto preview doc/filename.ipynb
```
This will produce an output similar to:
```text
Browse at http://localhost:7887/
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7887/
```
Your default browser will automatically open an interactive preview of the notebook.

You can also specify a custom port using the `--port <port_number>` option.

## Exporting Slides
Alternatively, you can render each notebook as an HTML slide deck by running:
```bash
quarto render doc/filename.ipynb
```
The generated HTML files can then be opened in any modern web browser.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure you have Quarto and Jupyter properly installed before running any of the above commands.
- For more details and troubleshooting, refer to the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
